# Star Projection

Made for the **HackTheSkies** hackathon of 2024 as a UnityPackage for the [StarFinder](https://github.com/Sickkle/StarFinder) project in the team **Hack The Ground**.

This package takes the longitude of the user's location, and projects a large number of stars based on the **Hipparcos Star Astronomy Catalog** with various sizes and brightness.

Download and put the **StarProjection.unitypackage** file in the Unity project to start using.
